TrainingBot is a ready-made solution for creating a bot that will register participants for trainings. It is based on two templates that allow you to work with both the SQLite database and openpyxl files.

Pros of using this particular template:
- Built-in command prompt with administration commands directly from a script
- Ability to work with SQLite and Openpyxl simultaneously
